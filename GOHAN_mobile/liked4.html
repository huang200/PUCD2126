          <span class="text">In November 2015, MUJI revealed a series of minimalist micro-homes during Tokyo Designers Week. The project was developed by the Japanese home-goods stalwart alongside designers Naoto Fukasawa, Jasper Morrison and Konstantin Grcic.<br/> Recently, the retailer announced that the tiny huts are slated to hit the market in Japan by autumn 2017.<br/>
          In its initial preview, MUJI showcased a bevy of compact sheds that employ traditional Japanese aesthetics.<br/> This time around, images of a more pared-back abode surfaces, boasting a height of 10 square meters, a sizable living space that can comfortably fit up to four individuals, as well as tall sliding glass doors that allow plenty of light to seep inside. <br/>It’s entirely made up of cedar wood with burned hardwood as a protective shell to help brave the natural elements.<br/> Not to mention, it’s built on top of a raft foundation that is durable and protects from ground moisture.</span>
