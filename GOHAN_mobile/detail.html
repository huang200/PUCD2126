          <span class="text">After 《The Walking Dead》 season #7 started, AMC brings another good news for fans. The CEO of AMC, Charile Collier, announced AMC would renew #8. 《The Walking Dead》 season #8 will be broadcast in the end of 2017.<br/> 
          AMC is the powerhouse cable network that has brought fans The Walking Dead, Breaking Bad, Mad Men, and many more outstanding fan-frenzy shows over the years.<br/>  With previous reports that AMC stocks were in trouble, good news has finally come down the pipeline for the entertainment company and its No. 1 cable drama, The Walking Dead.<br/> 
          Although Season 7A of The Walking Dead started out rough, even with it massive premiere, the tides of public sentiment seem to be turning in favor of AMC and loyal fans of The Walking Dead.<br/>  But the people who are really getting a breath of fresh air are the stockholders who may have been looking to divest themselves from AMC following the sagging 2016 ratings of The Walking Dead.</span>
